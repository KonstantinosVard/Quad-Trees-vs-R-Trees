# Quad-Trees-vs-R-Trees
 Implementation and comprehensive comparison of two spatial data structures: Quad Trees and R-Trees, for efficient handling of geospatial data. The implementation includes optimized algorithms for range queries and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) searches, with extensive performance analysis on real-world geographic datasets.
